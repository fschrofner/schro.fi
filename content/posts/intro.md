# Hi, it's me :wave:

My name is Florian Schrofner, I'm an Android developer from beautiful Salzburg Austria.  
Currently I craft wonderful apps at [LOOP](https://www.agentur-loop.com/) for clients like ADAC or MyClubs.  
I specialized on Google's operating system as I appreciate its openness and flexibility, although both of which can sometimes be a headache during development :shrug:  
On my workstations I run Linux for the same reasons, my distribution of choice being [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) as I became too lazy to setup Arch Linux from scratch every time.  
Aside from coding and tinkering, I also enjoy doing sports, most importantly cycling, but you can find me in the gym as well from time to time or spot me going for a run in my neighbourhood.  
Most of the time I like listening to music while doing so, and I generally prefer to have some nice tracks playing while I'm working. Alas, describing my music taste would be too tricky, so better check out my Last.fm profile linked below yourself.  
Additionally, I recently started to excessively listen to podcasts, I found it to be a nice way to get some entertainment without straining my eyes even more after a full day's work in front of the screen.  
In case my eyes are still good, I also like to watch some interesting movies from time to time, you can check out my Mubi profile [here](https://mubi.com/users/7455172) (once Font Awesome adds a Mubi icon I will move it to the other social links below :wink:)
