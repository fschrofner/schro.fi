# Hi, it's me :wave:

My name is Florian Schrofner, I'm an Android developer from the beautiful city of Salzburg, Austria.  
Currently I craft wonderful apps at [LOOP](https://www.agentur-loop.com/) for clients like ADAC or MyClubs.  
I specialized on Google's operating system as I appreciate its openness and flexibility, although both of which can sometimes cause a headache during development :shrug:  
For mainly the same reasons I'm a longtime Linux user as well, my distribution of choice being [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) as I became too lazy to setup Arch Linux from scratch every time.  

Aside from coding and tinkering, I also enjoy doing sports, most importantly cycling, but you can find me in the gym too from time to time or spot me going for a run around the neighbourhood.  
Occasionally I like listening to music while doing so, but I definitely need it while working. Alas, describing my music taste would be too tricky, so better check out my Last.fm profile linked below yourself.  
Additionally, I recently started to excessively listen to podcasts, I found it to be a nice way to get some entertainment without straining my eyes even more after a full day's work in front of the screen.  
Anyway, in case my eyes can still take it, I also like to watch some interesting movies once in a while, you can check out my Mubi profile [here](https://mubi.com/users/7455172) (as soon as Font Awesome adds a Mubi icon I will move it to the other social links below :wink:)  

Speaking of social networks, here are some links to the ones I've signed up for. Also find a link to my blog in the upper right corner :point_up:  
In case you want to drop me a mail, just send it to florian at this domain, as long as you're not a bot :robot:
