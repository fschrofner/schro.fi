# About the site :gear:

This is already the second version of my website and like the version before it was built with love and a cherry-picked selection of open source tools :raised_hands:  
Although, this time I exchanged some of the tools just to try something new.  
I decided to build the site using the popular [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) to keep the code cleaner and to use [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) conveniently, although a simple static HTML page would have done a good job as well.
Responsiveness is done using the flex grid of [Picnic CSS](https://picnicss.com/), which was also responsible for the blog button in the upper right corner. I love its simplicity!  
The main font I'm using, is called [Fira Sans](https://mozilla.github.io/Fira/) from Mozilla. The font I'm using for my name is called [Learning Curve](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Learning-Curve-Pro), while the icons I used for my social links come from [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/).  
The page is hosted in the Netherlands on a [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) server from [Liteserver](https://liteserver.nl/) running [Freedombox](https://freedombox.org/), which gives me the power to host a bunch of other services for myself :smiling_face_with_hearts:  
Those weird shapes are done using CSS' clip path with polygons, see the corresponding part of my CSS [here](https://github.com/fschrofner/schro.fi/blob/9eb9d4d11ab112a7a3715f2d51e32331b7d1d268/assets/sass/main.sass#L35).
Also the rest of the changes to this website are done in public, you can find the source code [here](https://github.com/fschrofner/schro.fi)
